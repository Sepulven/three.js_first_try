# three.js_first_try
My first experience with three.js, creating my first scene.

## Scene

Scenes allow you to set up what is to be rendered by three.js and where it is in 3D coordinates. We need a scene, The scene is also sometimes referred to as the scene graph. We can have multiple scenes. When you have a scene, you can then add objects and lighting.

## Renderer

The Renderer displays the scene onto a HTML Canvas Element. By default it uses WebGL. WebGL allows GPU-accelerated image processing and effects as the renderer creates the 2D image for the Canvas.

## Camera

There are many types of Cameras in Threejs. In this video we experiment with the Perspective and the Orthographic cameras.

## Note:
    In order to run the example:
    ```npx vite```
